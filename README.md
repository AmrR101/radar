# `RadaR` ![logo_radar](man/figures/radar.png)
RadaR is an application for intuitive, rapid and reproducible quality of care pattern analysis of infectious patients. 

## Prerequisites for using RadaR
RadaR was built in [R](https://www.r-project.org) , an open source programming language using the [Shiny package](https://shiny.rstudio.com), a web application framework for R. Users will need to download R in order to use RadaR and we suggest the use of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). R is completely free to use. 

## Input type for RadaR's calculation
RadaR works with standard csv-files (.csv). The variables needed for RadaR are as follows:

Usually different data sources need to be merged for the desired result (at our institution three different sources: general data warehouse, pharmacy data, microbiology data). For an easy and rapid creating of the needed datasets that can be loaded into RadaR, an additional R-package will soon be available here in this github repository.
